>Submission: Search Engine Feature Pack
>Writtern in Python

Just wanted to keep this as a memory. I'm not sure if all the APIs inside this python project work as they did back in 2012!
I didn't [win](https://blog.udacity.com/2012/05/winners-of-udacitys-cs101-contest.html) that [contest](https://blog.udacity.com/2012/07/udacity-contest-winners-cash-in-their.html), but it has been one of the most exciting times of my life!

There was a [showcase site](https://blog.udacity.com/2012/09/udacity-showcase-share-your-udacious.html) on Udacity website for all the submissions to that contest, which seems to be down at the moment!
